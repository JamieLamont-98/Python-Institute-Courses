Objectives
improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
using the find() method for searching strings.
Scenario
Let's play a game. We will give you two strings: one being a word (e.g., "dog") and the second being a combination of any characters.

Your task is to write a program which answers the following question: are the characters comprising the first string hidden inside the second string?

For example:

if the second string is given as "vcxzxduybfdsobywuefgas", the answer is yes;
if the second string is "vcxzxdcybfdstbywuefsas", the answer is no (as there are neither the letters "d", "o", or "g", in this order)
Hints:

you should use the two-argument variants of the pos() functions inside your code;
don't worry about case sensitivity.
Test your code using the data we've provided.

Test data
Sample input:

donor
Nabucodonosor

Sample output:

Yes


Sample input:

donut
Nabucodonosor

Sample output:

No
